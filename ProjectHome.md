Reference documentation for open-source software in convenient HTML-based formats (such as [CHM](CHM.md), [DevHelp](DevHelp.md), [HTB](HTB.md), etc.) and tools for its generation, conversion, and visualization.

This project aims to provide:
  * [reference documentation of open-source software](http://code.google.com/p/htmlhelp/downloads/list) in convenient HTML-based formats;
  * to provide the [tools](Tools.md) for the generating such books from the primary documentation formats and for converting among the different formats;
  * an [web interface](WebInterface.md) for browsing the books on-line;
  * and perhaps in the future a canonic XML-based HTML help format for conversion.

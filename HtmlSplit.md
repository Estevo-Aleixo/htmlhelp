# Introduction #

This is a python script to split a HTML page into multiple pages, putting each `h2` heading in a separate HTML file.

It was created for and tested with the [w3c specifications](http://www.w3.org/). It will likely fail with other files without change.

# Usage #

```
htmlsplit.py html ...
```

		<h2>Welcome to HTML Help Books</h2>
		
		<p>
		HTML Help Books aims to be <em>the</em> web site for
		online developer reference documentation. It provides reference manuals for
		open-source software, programming languages, web specifications, and
		more. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Each book includes a navigatable table of contents, a searchable index, and
		allows full-text search of its pages.  The book catalog is organized by
		tags for easy lookup.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Two interfaces are available for browsing books. One is uses plain HTML
		with frames, and only requires a frame-enabled web browser.  The other uses
		remote <a href="http://xulplanet.com/">XUL</a> for a richer interaction, but requires a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Gecko-based web browser</a>,
		with JavaScript enabled.  The appropriate interface is deduced
		automatically from the browser capabilities.

Using a web interfaces for a book repository has many advantages, such as
platform independence and remote access.

This is not an original concept. Other projects with similar aim are/were:

  - Linux Developer Network - a website service that offer programming function
    reference for the Linux/Gnome platform. It uses DevHelp scheme to show
    documents and the XML to index the documents.

  - arCHMage - an extensible online reader/decompiler of files in CHM format.
    It can be run as a standalone HTTP server or as an Apache mod_python
    handler.

Some projects have an interactive web interface for their own documentation:

  - PHP Online Documentation

  - MYSQL Online Documentation

Other projects spawn local HTTP servers to provide user documentation:

  - Python's pydoc

  - Eclipse's context help system

There are some problems [with libstc++]:
- the stream-classes aren't documented at all
- some pages (e.g. "contents/modules/stl extensions from sgi") look strange and
  quite right-aligned
- the class names do not show up directly in the index (e.g. vector is only
  visible as std::vector)

The last two points are quite minor, but the missing stream documentation is
bad. Why is it missing?

I've found that the descriptions of string class and basic_string class
template are missing. So is the file: <string>.

To my surprise, there is a <basic_string.h> file, but there are none of the
apropriate keywords in help viewer on index tab, like: "basic_string" or
"string", and more: "basic_ostringstream", "basic_istringstream",
"basic_stringbuf", and the like.  There are also missing "getline()" member and
"getline()" function template, which is very useful, since one can make a call
like this:

  string s;  getline(cin, s);

Looks like doxygen configuration problem to me. Can I ask you to take a look at
it? You know, the string class is really useful and we want students to learn
how to use it. Right documentation would be very appreciated.

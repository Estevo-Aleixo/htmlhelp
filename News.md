**2007-12-21**: Migrated the project to [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/htmlhelp/).

> With the migration I also added new books and dropped some old books.

**2007-03-16**: First public release of [pyhtmlhelp](pyhtmlhelp.md), a tool written in Python which allows to convert books from/to CHM, HTB, and DevHelp formats.

**2005-10-20**: The http://htmlhelp.dotsrc.org/ site has been launched. It provides many HTML Help books with a simple, efficient web-based interface.

**2005-03-31**: Updated CHM and HTB books.

**2004-11-13**: The existing subversion repository was imported into Berlios repository.

**2004-02-10**: Perl Documentation in CHM format.

> After quite some struggle I managed to get the Perl documentation in CHM (and HTB) format. It still has some quirks, but at least it looks good - it uses the CSS stylesheet from http://www.perldoc.com/. As usual, the whole process is automated (nicely into a pair of shell scripts) so that newer perl versions can be tracked without effort.

**2004-01-31**: Converting from any format to DevHelp book -- It is now possible to generate DevHelp books from other formats (such as CHM, and HTB) using the HTML Help Python API.

**2004-01-20** Remote XUL interface -- Added a **remote** XUL interface to the PHP web interface for Gecko-based browsers.
